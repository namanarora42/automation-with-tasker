# Missed Call Alert

We live in a world where we are constantly at risk of getting distracted by our phones. Often times, you might want to silence your phone and get disconnected, whether it is for a meeting, or just taking a break. How many times have you fogotten taking your phone off silent, or missed an extremely urgent phone call that you could have justified a distraction for? 

# Problem 

In the metaverse that we are moving towards, being unavailable to take an urgent could very well be a life or death situation. I created this project after getting my parents worried about my well being, as I had slept off during the day with my phone on silent, and no way for them to contact me. 

# Solution

For a repeat caller, I would want them to know that my phone is on silent and I'm unable to hear it. If they still want to go ahead with their call, I want to allow them, and provide them a way to "break" the silence of my phone. After every missed call, I track all missed calls for the next 10 minutes. This tracking can be aborted if I need to. 

Tracking started: 


After the second phone goes unanswered from the same caller (thus getting 2 missed calls), Tasker sends an automated response to the caller. 

Automated Response Sent to Caller:

If the caller still wishes to break the silence and make my phone ring, they will call again. And this time if I don't answer, my phone will come out of "Silent" mode and start ringing, thus waking me up/alerting me of the urgency. 

It starts playing media in full screen and shows a button that will disable the disable the ringer.
