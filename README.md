 _Tasker is the reason why I was drawn to computer programming back in 2012._

## What is Tasker?

From the [Tasker website](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) - 

Tasker is an application for Android which performs tasks (sets of actions) based on contexts (application, time, date, location, event, gesture) in user-defined profiles or in clickable or timed home screen widgets.

This simple concept profoundly extends your control of your Android device and it's capabilities, without the need for 'root' or a special home screen.

I have automated just about everything possible on my phone and at home using fun Tasker projects.

In this repo, I will be sharing some of my projects that I use to make everyday life easier.

Index

1. [Missed Call Alert](https://github.com/namanarora97/automation-with-tasker/tree/main/Missed-Call-Alert)

A profile to make sure you never miss another urgent call, no matter what the situation is. 

2. [SOS Location Sharing](https://github.com/namanarora97/automation-with-tasker/tree/main/SOS-Location)

A simple script that helps you locate your phone without internet. You just need another phone that is capable of sending an SMS message to your phone.

3. [Smarter Alarm Clock](https://github.com/namanarora97/automation-with-tasker/tree/main/Smarter-Alarm-Clock)

Have you ever heard of those challenging alarm clock apps that make you solve math problems to dismiss the alarm? This is sort of like that, but way smarter.

4. [Ring My Phone](https://github.com/namanarora97/automation-with-tasker/tree/main/Ring-My-Phone)

Ring your phone from anywhere to find where it is. Does not need internet!

5. [MFA Catcher](https://github.com/namanarora97/automation-with-tasker/tree/main/MFA-Catcher)

Sync your MFA codes instantly to your desktop clipboard or a second device you are using. No more finding your phone to locate one time passcodes.
