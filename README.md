 _Tasker is the reason why I was drawn to computer programming back in 2012._

## What is Tasker?

From the [Tasker website](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) - 

>Tasker is an application for Android which performs tasks (sets of actions) based on contexts (application, time, date, location, event, gesture) in user-defined profiles or in clickable or timer home screen widgets.

>This simple concept profoundly extends your control of your Android device and it's capabilities, without the need for 'root' or a special home screen.

I have automated just about everything possible on my phone and at home using fun Tasker projects.

In this repo, I will be sharing some of my projects that I use to make everyday life easier.
